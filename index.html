                        <p>In the story of us, I'm the guy who keeps it simple but loves you in ways beyond your wildest dreams. Words often fail me, but my love for you has no limits. Sure, I get a bit worked up over little things, but in those moments, I realize just how much you mean to me. My loyalty to you runs deep, and despite my outward appearance of maturity, I'm still figuring things out. When it comes to you, I might seem strong, but truth be told, I'm easily shaken if anything out of the ordinary happens to my one and only. Call me overpossesive, but it's only because I care so much. And if I ever get a little hot-headed, know that it's never from a bad place—it hurts me deeply if my actions cause any hurt.</p>

                        <p>My girl, she's this incredibly innocent and charming soul with a heart full of expectations, and you know what they say about meeting a woman's demands – it's a challenge. But I give it my all because she's worth every effort. Her playful spirit brings joy to every moment, and her love for me knows no boundaries. She'd go to any lengths just to see a smile on my face, making every day feel special. Sure, she has her moods, but her happiness is intertwined with mine.

Over the five years we've been together, she's been my constant, never letting me feel alone. I'll forever hold onto those moments of pure happiness when we were side by side. No matter how tough things got, she stood by me, understanding me even in my moments of anger. And here's the magic – no matter how upset I might get, she won't rest until she turns my frown upside down. She's the answer to all my life problems, and I can't imagine a life without her by my side.</p>

                            <p class="m-0">Our first chat was super special! I talked to you on Facebook with the help of my best friend and his girlfriend. I felt a mix of things – scared, shy, and really excited all at the same time. I remember saying, "Hi Nazia? got your Fb id from a friend." After a few minutes of chatting, without hesitation I told you, "I really like you," and you replied with a sweet "Me too." Even though I was hoping for a longer answer, those two words made me dance with happiness!</p>

                            <p class="m-0">Yeah I Know this wasn't our first meet but I consider this day as our First Official Meet because this was the day when our hearts connected. It happened during the Teachers' Day celebration at our tuition. The day was filled with fun and excitement, but what made it extraordinary was the connection between our hearts. You had some interesting demands, wanting me to propose to you properly.

                                So, after the celebration, I took you aside and, just like you wanted, proposed to you while kneeling on the ground. It felt like my heart was warming up, and then, for the first time, I hugged you. It was my first time being so close to a girl. I can still remember the touch, our hearts connecting, and hearing your heartbeat. I held your waist as we walked, feeling like a perfect couple. By the way, you still have that slim waist - hahaha!</p>

                            <p class="m-0">Our school days were the absolute best, filled with the sweetest moments as we tried our best to spend time together. It was our young love that led us to do some silly things, like skipping tuition classes and finding secret spots to meet. We did all sorts of goofy stuff just to see each other, and we became so carefree that we didn't care what others thought about us. We took big risks just to make each other smile.

                                Back then, I never imagined we would come this far together. We faced some really tough problems, times that seemed like they could be the end. But I believed in us and in my God, and look at how far we've come.</p>

                            <p class="m-0">Our university romance felt like a sign from above, as if even God was cheering for our love story. It seemed almost impossible, and we could hardly believe it ourselves – being in the same university. I never imagined I'd be so fortunate to have my girlfriend right there with me. The day I met you on campus filled my heart with joy.

                                Everything just fell into place. You made all my wishes come true, from the romantic to the cozy ones. We had the chance to spend so much time together. Like any other relationship, we had our share of minor issues, but that's okay – it only added to the strength of our bond.
                                
                                The days and times we shared, whether it was wandering around the university, finding secret spots, or studying in the library, each moment spent with you is etched in my memory as something truly special and memorable.</p>

                            <p class="text-uppercase mb-2">2023 - 2024</p>
                            <p class="m-0">We've come to the part of our story where everything turned upside down. In 2023, a new chapter began, filled with good things in my life. I got a job in an IT company during my last semester in college. Excitement filled me as I started the internship, but it brought challenges to our relationship. Long-distance was tough, and things got ugly. Somehow, we faced the difficulties together. When my internship ended, her college was over too. I lost my job, but by some miracle, I found another one in Chandigarh. It felt like God was on our side, making us lucky and believing in true love. She got admission to a university near me, and we were happy again.

                                But the climax was different. I ruined everything. Blinded by ego and anger, I mistreated her, treated her badly, and she couldn't take it. It was me, not her, who broke her heart and made her leave. I did things I never thought I would.
                                
                                Now, over three months after our breakup, I'm struggling with my life. Health issues forced me to leave my job and sit at home for three months. After realizing my mistakes, I've been trying to convince her to come back. But the damage is done; she has moved on, treating me like a stranger. I wish I could undo the harm I caused. Despite my efforts, the trauma I gave her has changed her completely. I don't know how I'll live my life without her. It feels like a sad ending, and I still hope she lives a better life, getting everything she wants.</p>

                        As I pen down these words, tears well up in my eyes. Having you in my life when I needed it most has been an immense blessing. Five years with you brought numerous life lessons, and you taught me what true love is. Navigating through both joy and sorrow with you by my side was like a gift from the heavens. I wish things could have remained the same; the thought of us not being together anymore pains my heart deeply.
                        
                        Witnessing you move on was a hurtful experience I never anticipated. Although this day seemed distant, I'll always respect whatever decision you make. At times, doubts crept in, making me wonder if we were truly meant for each other. Yet, in magical moments, we believed we were a perfect match. Despite the challenges we faced, we always found a way through. I yearn for time to freeze at the moments we shared, wishing I could declare our togetherness as eternal.
                        
                        It saddens me to think about completing the project dedicated entirely to you. Self-doubt clouds my mind, questioning if my efforts will ever reach you or be appreciated. Presently, worst-case scenarios dominate my thoughts, fueled by your recent demeanor. I'm prepared for the possibility that I might not reach your heart. Still, I hold onto the hope that you'll take a moment, reflect on everything, and return my love. This journey is incredibly tough for me, and I hope you can understand the depth of my feelings and efforts for you.
